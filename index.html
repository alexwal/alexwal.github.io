<h1 id="ExperienceProjects">Experience and Projects</h1>
<p>I’ve done research, internships, and tons of <a href="http://awal.io/coursework.html">courses</a> (35 science and math) to get a better feel for the fields I am interested in. Here’s a quick summary of recent work. My Github account and full CV are available in the sidebar.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Research</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Since 2014, I am a proud undergraduate researcher in the <a href="http://www.maharbizgroup.wordpress.com/">Maharbiz Group</a> at UC Berkeley in collaboration with the <a href="http://cafgroup.lbl.gov/">Molecular Foundry</a> at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.</li>
      <li>By anchoring bacterial flagella to glass, we study and control <em>E. coli</em> flagellar dynamics.</li>
      <li>Flagellar dyanmics are influenced by surrounding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis#Chemoattractants_and_chemorepellents">chemoattractant</a> concentration.</li>
      <li>We observe the rotation of bacteria with fluorescence microscopy, as well as using microelectrode impedance readings.</li>
      <li>To speed up our research, I write image processing scripts that segment bacteria and automatically analyze rotation patterns.</li>
      <li>One application of this research is using bacteria as a biosensor.</li>
      <li>Another application steers a bacterium by flowing particular concentrations through a microfluidic device.</li>
      <li>In August, my team’s poster <a href="http://maharbizgroup.wordpress.com/2016/08/03/tom-zajdel-wins-outstanding-poster-award-from-the-biophysical-journal/">won an award</a>!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li><strong>Industry</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Over the summer, I was a computer vision research intern at <a href="http://www.umbocv.com/">Umbo CV</a> in Taipei, Taiwan.</li>
      <li>I developed few-shot learning program that makes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">CNN</a> learn new objects in real time.</li>
      <li>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/alexwal/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Demo">demo and code</a>.</li>
      <li>This job also familiarized me with modern CV research: I studied and presented multiple conference papers to the company’s CV group.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Coursework</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>In robotics, my group built an <a href="http://sites.google.com/view/zumymazesolver" target="_blank">Autonomous Maze Solving Robot</a>. Our <a href="http://wiki.eecs.berkeley.edu/biomimetics/Main/Zumy">Zumy</a> finds its way through arbitirary mazes!</li>
      <li>I developed <a href="http://github.com/alexwal/ios-decal-final-pro">Activity</a>, an iOS final project, which uses iPhone accelerometer, gyro, and GPS data to measure and track a user’s activity.</li>
      <li>In a DSP course, I completed <a href="https://github.com/alexwal/EE123-Labs">various projects</a>, including: a laptop sonar, a flight radar receiver, MRI compressed sensing lab, and wavelet compression-based image transmission over radio.</li>
      <li>In a circuits course, I created a black and white “<a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16a/sp15/Labs/imaging/ee16a_imaging_lab2.html">camera</a>” from an Arduino and solar cell.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Activities" class="padded_scroll_target">What do I do in my free time?</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Study Chinese</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I have taken four years of Mandarin classes at Berkeley and in Beijing.</li>
      <li>I am a Berkeley <a href="http://ls.berkeley.edu/academic-programs/arts-humanities/huang-program-uc-berkeley">Huang Scholar</a> and my Chinese name is 常浩天.</li>
      <li>In 2015, I completed a pledge to only speak Chinese for 8 weeks as a student of <a href="http://pib.princeton.edu/">Princeton in Beijing</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Travel</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The last three summers, I have been grateful to receive merit scholarships to fund my studies and travel to East Asia.</li>
      <li>After freshman year, I also studied abroad in Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand) thanks to <a href="http://www.santander.com/csgs/Satellite/CFWCSancomQP01/en_GB/Corporate/Sustainability/Santander-Universities-/Santander-Grants/Global-Programs.html">Banco Santander</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Ski</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>My favorite activity is going on Lake Tahoe cabin trips with Cal’s ski and snowboard club.</li>
      <li>Last winter break, we drove 1,000 miles from Berkeley to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/University+of+California,+Berkeley,+Berkeley,+CA+94720/Red+Mountain+Resort,+4300+Red+Mountain+Rd,+Rossland,+BC+V0G+1Y0,+Canada/@46.2038899,-121.2042873,6z/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x808f7718c522d7c1:0xda8034ea3b6b3289!2m2!1d-122.2585399!2d37.8718992!1m5!1m1!1s0x5362d065a8f54dd7:0x3f741de2c8f83edf!2m2!1d-117.8194626!2d49.1024039">Red Mountain</a>, British Columbia.</li>
